        A PHOTO OF TIMES SQUARE - TAKEN IN NEW YORK THE DAY BEFORE MY MATH 135 EXAM. I WAS THERE FOR AN ON-SITE CO-WORKING SESSION AT A STARTUP.

        I THINK I WANNA KEEP THIS SHORT BUT I DO HAVE A LOT OF THOUGHTS. ITS INSANE HOW FIRST TERM HAS ALREADY COME TO AN END. I GUESS WE DO START TO PERCEIVE TIME MORE QUICKLY AS WE AGE.
        I THINK IVE LEARNED A LOT OVERALL JUST ABOUT LIFE - MY GOALS - AND OTHER PEOPLE JUST THROUGH EXPERIENCING THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF SE FIRST HAND.

    <div className="text-[15px]">
        HONESTLY - I CAME IN THINKING THAT 1A WOULD BE A LOT MORE EASY THAN IT WAS. COMING FROM IB - I WAS DEFINITELY USED TO THE SE WORKLOAD.
        HOWEVER - I THINK THE AMOUNT OF CONSTANT STUDYING THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO NOT FALL BEHIND DEFINITELY TOPS THAT OF IB. THE BUSYNESS OF IB SEEMS TO COME MORE IN WAVES.
        THE RUSH FOR STUDYING FOR MIDTERMS AND FINALS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IB THOUGH.
        I THINK I SHOULDNT HAVE SLACKED OFF SO MUCH NEAR THE END OF THE TERM. LETS JUST SAY THE MARK DROP BETWEEN MY MIDTERMS AND FINALS REFLECTS THAT QUITE A BIT.

    <div className="text-[15px]">
       NEXT - IVE BEGAN TO REALIZE HOW WATERLOO AND LINKEDIN IS OFTEN JUST AN ECHO CHAMBER OF NOISE AND PEOPLE OBSESSING OVER THE "CALI OR BUST" MENTALITY - STARTUPS - OR THEIR NEXT BIG
       INTERNSHIP. NOW DONT GET ME WRONG - I THINK ITS GREAT TO LOVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING BUT IVE REALIZED IF YOURE DOING IT SOLELY FOR THE MONEY OR THE PRESTIGE
       OF IT - THEN YOURE JUST SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR BURNOUT AND UNHAPPINESS. MANY PEOPLE TAKE IT SO FAR TO WHERE THEIR IDENTITY BECOMES SOLELY ABOUT WHERE THEY WORK AND HOW MUCH OF A 10X FOUNDER/ENGINEER/PERSON THEY ARE.
       AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN SENSE IT INDIRECTLY BEHIND CERTAIN 'LINKEDINFLUENCERS' POSTS. IT SOUNDS VERY CORNY BUT ITS TRUE.

       WHAT IVE REALIZED IS THAT I WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON THINGS THAT I TRULY FIND INTERESTING - RATHER THAN FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY OR RESUME FODDER.
       I THINK A PIVOT TOWARDS SYSTEMS - INFRA - AND LOW LEVEL ENGINEERING WOULD BE THE MOST REWARDING FOR ME.
       I THINK I WILL TRY AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NITTY GRITTY OF LOW LEVEL LANGUAGES LIKE C++ AND RUST AND HOW THEY ARE USED IRL (ROS 2 - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS - OS KERNELS - ETC).
    </div>

    <div className="text-[15px]">
       ANYWAYS YEAH. I SHOULD PROBABLY STOP GOOFING AROUND ALL DAY AND LOCK IN NEXT SEMESTER. OVERALL - I THINK THE SEMESTER WAS
       A GOOD LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME - THE JOURNEY IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING.
