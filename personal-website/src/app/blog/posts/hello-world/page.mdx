        FLYING THE INIBUILDS A350 IN MSFS2024 - A REFERENCE FOR MY PORTFOLIO
    </p>

    BUILT WITH NEXTJS TAILWINDCSS AND SVG - THIS SITE IS DESIGNED IN THE STYLE OF THE AIRBUS A350 FMS BECAUSE ITS MY FAVORITE AIRCRAFT.

    I WANTED MY PORTFOLIO TO REFLECT MY BIGGEST PASSIONS OF SOFTWARE AND FLIGHT SIMULATION AND SO I MODELED IT AFTER THE FEEL OF THE A350.

    I HOPE YOU ENJOY EXPLORING IT AS MUCH AS I ENJOYED BUILDING IT.
